# My Bookshelf App
##### Project from the *Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree* at Udacity

#### Introduction

**Title**: My Bookshelf

by Steve Hanlon

*My Bookshelf* is a web app for storing books from an API and categorizing them on three shelves: *Currently Reading*, *Want to Read* and *Read*.  

Each book has a select menu allowing the user to move the book to a different shelf or remove it from the bookshelf entirely.

The lower right side of the screen shows a **+** icon linking to a Search interface.

The **Search** interface has a search input at top which is used to retrieve search results via an API call.  It then displays all books and their menus, which must show the correct shelf or "none" status (i.e. status matches the status shown in **My Bookshelf**)
